# DevConnect Treasure Hunt Feature

## Concept
Interactive scavenger hunt where users work together in small groups to find items around the venue, submit photos via XMTP, and have an AI agent validate their submissions.

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User clicks "Treasure Hunt" button in Rocky's menu
2. Rocky randomly assigns them to 1 of 20 pre-created XMTP groups (balanced distribution)
3. Group receives their first task (e.g., "Find something blue")
4. Team members search together, take a photo
5. Submit photo in group chat by mentioning `@devconnectarg` with the image
6. Rocky validates the photo using OpenAI Vision
7. If validated âœ…, Rocky sends the next task
8. Repeat until all 10 tasks completed
9. First group to complete all tasks wins!

### Example Tasks (10 total)
- Find something blue
- Take a photo with someone wearing a DevConnect shirt
- Find the La Rural sign
- Group photo with all members
- Find a laptop with Ethereum sticker
- etc.

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema (PostgreSQL on Railway)
```sql
-- Track each group's progress
CREATE TABLE treasure_hunt_groups (
  group_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  current_task_index INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  completed_tasks JSONB, -- Array of completed task indices
  started_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  completed_at TIMESTAMP
);

-- Track user assignments (prevent users from joining multiple groups)
CREATE TABLE treasure_hunt_participants (
  user_inbox_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  group_id TEXT REFERENCES treasure_hunt_groups(group_id),
  joined_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Track photo submissions and validations
CREATE TABLE treasure_hunt_submissions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  group_id TEXT REFERENCES treasure_hunt_groups(group_id),
  task_index INTEGER NOT NULL,
  image_url TEXT,
  submitted_by TEXT,
  validated BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  ai_response TEXT,
  timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Index for faster lookups
CREATE INDEX idx_group_progress ON treasure_hunt_groups(current_task_index);
CREATE INDEX idx_submissions_group ON treasure_hunt_submissions(group_id, task_index);
```

### Key Components Needed

#### 1. Group Pre-Creation
- Create 20 XMTP groups: "Treasure Hunt #1" through "#20"
- Store group IDs in config
- Agent must be added to all groups
- **Script needed:** `createTreasureHuntGroups.ts`

#### 2. Random Assignment
- When user clicks button, find least-full group
- Add user to that group
- Record assignment in PostgreSQL database
- Send welcome message with first task
- **File:** `src/services/agent/tools/treasureHunt.ts`

#### 3. Image Validation
- Detect when user sends image + mention in treasure hunt group
- Download/decrypt XMTP remote attachment
- Send to OpenAI Vision API with task-specific prompt
- Parse response (YES/NO + explanation)
- Update database and send next task if valid
- **Uses:** OpenAI `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4-vision-preview`

#### 4. Conditional Quick Actions
- Each group sees different buttons based on their current task
- Button says "ðŸ“¸ Submit [Current Task]"
- Only show to users in active treasure hunt groups

#### 5. Task Definitions
```typescript
const TASKS = [
  {
    index: 0,
    description: "Find something blue and take a photo",
    validationPrompt: "Does this image show a blue object? YES or NO.",
    hint: "Look around the venue for blue items!"
  },
  // ... 9 more
];
```

## Technical Requirements

### Infrastructure
- âœ… PostgreSQL database on Railway (migrating from SQLite)
- âœ… XMTP client (already have)
- âœ… OpenAI API access (already have)
- âœ… Quick Actions framework (already have)
- ðŸ”¨ Image handling (XMTP remote attachments - need to add)
- ðŸ”¨ 20 pre-created XMTP groups (need to create)

### New Dependencies
- None! Everything uses existing packages

### Estimated Costs
- **OpenAI Vision**: ~$0.01 per image validation
- **Total for 200 users**: ~$20 (200 users Ã— 10 photos = 2000 validations)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- [ ] Add database tables
- [ ] Create "Treasure Hunt" button in menu
- [ ] Build group assignment logic
- [ ] Create 20 XMTP groups
- [ ] Define 10 tasks

### Phase 2: Core Logic (Week 1)
- [ ] Implement image detection in groups
- [ ] Add XMTP remote attachment handling
- [ ] Build OpenAI Vision validation
- [ ] Add progress tracking

### Phase 3: Polish (Week 2)
- [ ] Add conditional Quick Actions per group
- [ ] Build leaderboard/completion notifications
- [ ] Add admin commands to reset/monitor
- [ ] Test with multiple users

### Phase 4: Testing (Week 2)
- [ ] Test with 5-10 people
- [ ] Tune validation prompts
- [ ] Fix edge cases
- [ ] Add rate limiting

## Risk Mitigation

### Challenge: Image validation accuracy
**Solution:** Start with simpler tasks (colors, signs), tune prompts, add manual override

### Challenge: Race conditions (multiple submissions)
**Solution:** Use PostgreSQL transactions, mark task as "submitted" during validation

### Challenge: Uneven group distribution
**Solution:** Assign to least-full group, cap at 10 users per group

### Challenge: Users join multiple groups
**Solution:** Check PostgreSQL before assignment, one group per user (enforced by PRIMARY KEY constraint)

## Success Metrics
- Number of groups participating
- Average completion time
- Photo submission rate
- Validation accuracy
- User engagement/feedback

## Open Questions for Team
1. Should there be a time limit per task?
2. What happens if a group gets stuck?
3. Should we allow hints/skips?
4. Prize for winning group?
5. Should leaderboard be public or private?
