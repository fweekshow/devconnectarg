# Quick Actions Fix - Complete

## Problem
Agent was falling back to plain text instead of sending Quick Actions buttons in Base App.

## Root Cause
Agent SDK's context (`ctx`) doesn't have a `.send()` method for custom content types. We were calling `ctx.send()` which doesn't exist, causing errors.

## Solution
Use the raw XMTP client conversation to send custom content types:

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - ctx.send doesn't exist
await ctx.send(quickActionsContent, ContentTypeActions);

// ✅ CORRECT - Access raw conversation through client
const conversation = await ctx.client.conversations.getConversationById(conversationId);
if (conversation) {
  await conversation.send(quickActionsContent, ContentTypeActions);
}
```

## What Was Fixed
- ✅ All greeting/welcome Quick Actions
- ✅ Broadcast command Quick Actions  
- ✅ All Intent handler Quick Actions (schedule, wifi, logistics, etc.)
- ✅ Group joining Quick Actions
- ✅ Follow-up Quick Actions

## Content Type Verified
Per [Base App documentation](https://docs.base.org/base-app/agents/chat-agents):
- Content Type: `coinbase.com/actions:1.0` ✅
- Structure: Matches spec ✅
- Codec: Properly registered ✅

## Test Now

1. **Kill old agent:**
```bash
pkill -f "devconnect-concierge.*tsx"
```

2. **Start fresh agent:**
```bash
npm run dev:agent-sdk
```

3. **Send "hello" to your agent in Base App**

You should now see:
- Quick Actions menu with buttons
- Schedule, Wifi, Event Logistics, etc. options
- NOT plain text fallback

4. **Verify logs show:**
```
🔍 Attempting to send Quick Actions with ContentTypeActions: coinbase.com/actions:1.0
✅ Sent Quick Actions welcome message
```

## If Still Failing

Check logs for detailed error:
```bash
npm run dev:agent-sdk 2>&1 | grep -A 5 "Quick Actions\|Error"
```
